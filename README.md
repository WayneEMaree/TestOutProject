# TestOutProject

#### 1. 'npm install', I believe all the dependencies are saved properly.

#### 2. 'npm run build' to build the project

#### 3. 'npm start' to generate a server to display the app on localhost:8080/ <DEPRECATED>

Any changes to config files require a rebuild.
Dist directory is cleaned on build. 
While npm start is active any changes will be automatically refreshed on the webpage.
